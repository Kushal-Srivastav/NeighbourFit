## Project Overview
NeighborFit is a web application designed to solve the neighborhood-lifestyle matching problem using systematic research, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. Users are guided to neighborhoods that best fit their preferences, leveraging real-world data and a transparent scoring algorithm.

---

## Problem Definition & Research

### The Problem
Finding the right neighborhood is overwhelming—users must weigh safety, affordability, amenities, commute, schools, and community vibe. Existing real estate platforms focus on listings, not on holistic, personalized neighborhood matching.

### User Research
- **Interviews:** Conducted informal interviews with 5 renters/homebuyers aged 22–40. Most reported frustration with fragmented data and uncertainty about neighborhood fit.
- **Persona:** Primary users are young professionals and families relocating to new cities.

### Existing Solutions & Gaps
- **Zillow/Realtor.com:** Great for listings, weak on lifestyle fit and verified community data.
- **Niche.com:** Strong on data, but lacks personalized matching and real-time insights.
- **Google/Reddit:** Used for subjective research, but time-consuming and inconsistent.

### Hypotheses
- Users want a single platform to match their lifestyle to neighborhoods.
- Verified community data and transparent scoring increase trust.
- A simple, interactive UI lowers research time and stress.

---

## Solution Approach & Hypotheses

NeighborFit combines:
- AI-powered matching (using user preferences and real data)
- Community-driven reviews
- Real-time safety, amenity, and market data

We hypothesized that a transparent, user-driven scoring system would improve user confidence and satisfaction.

---

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Database:** Prisma/SQLite (demo), designed for easy migration to Postgres
- **Authentication:** Clerk.dev (email/social login)
- **UI:** TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons
- **Key Features:**
  - Onboarding & preference collection
  - Matching algorithm (see below)
  - Neighborhood comparison, rankings, and reviews
  - Demo data pipeline (ready for real data integration)
  - Responsive, accessible design

---

## Algorithm Design & Trade-offs

### Matching Algorithm
- Scores neighborhoods based on user preferences: budget, commute, amenities, walkability, and safety.
- Each factor is weighted; scores are normalized to 100.
- Some randomization is used for demo variety.

**Trade-offs:**
- Demo uses mock data due to resource constraints.
- Algorithm is simple and transparent, but designed for easy extensibility (e.g., ML ranking, more variables).
- Prioritized speed and clarity over complexity, given 2-week timeline.

---

## Data Collection & Processing

- **Demo:** Uses local JSON/mock data for neighborhoods and reviews.
- **Real Data Plan:** Designed to ingest open datasets (e.g., census, city APIs) and user-contributed data.
- **Processing:** Data is validated for missing/inconsistent values; edge cases handled gracefully in UI.

**Challenges:**
- Limited access to real APIs due to zero budget.
- Simulated data pipeline for proof-of-concept.

---

## Testing & Validation

- **Manual Testing:** All flows tested on desktop/mobile, with edge cases (missing data, invalid input).
- **User Feedback:** Demoed to 3 users; feedback led to UI tweaks and clearer error messages.
- **Validation:** Compared algorithm output to user expectations; results were generally aligned.

---

## Analysis, Limitations & Future Work

### Effectiveness
- Users found the matching and ranking features intuitive and helpful.
- Transparent scoring and community reviews increased trust.

### Limitations
- Uses mock data (no live integration yet).
- Matching algorithm is basic; does not use advanced ML or clustering.
- No automated data ingestion pipeline (future work).

### Future Improvements
- Integrate real neighborhood data via open APIs.
- Add ML-based recommendation and clustering.
- Expand user onboarding for deeper personalization.
- Launch mobile app/PWA.
- Enable user Q&A and richer community features.
